# LeapFrog

LeapFrog is a Doodle-Jump inspired python-based game created with the Pygame module. The game features a frog player character which is controllable through left and right movement by either W and D or the left and right arrow keys. The player's goal is to collect and jump from as many flies as possible to increase their score and fly count. Touching the flies will cause the frog to bounce and the fly to relocate which will increase the score. To play the game, simply clone the repository and extract the .zip from the exe folder and launch the executable. This game is only able to be played on Windows operating systems.

Created along with [@ShivPatel123](https://github.com/ShivPatel123) for CSC Club introductory sample game during August 2021.
